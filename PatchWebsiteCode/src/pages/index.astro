		<p>Patch exists to bring exceptional young people into a community that takes them seriously. Talent on its own is fragile — it needs encouragement, peers, and examples of what's possible in order to grow.</p>

		<hr>

		<p>We don't prescribe paths or outcomes. Instead, we create the conditions where ambition is normal, curiosity is valued, and young people are consistently encouraged to aim higher than they might have on their own.</p>
